Using the notation from LINK TO PAPER, it supports polynomials finmathbbRx_1dotsx_n whose signed support (mathcalA_+mathcalA_-) satisfies dim(conv(mathcalA_+))=n and mathcalA_-subseteq int(conv(mathcalA_+)).\n\n","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"Use the following Julia commands to intall the package.\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/joan-ferrer/CopositivityDiscriminants.jl.git\")","category":"section"},{"location":"#CopositivityDiscriminants.CoposCheckResult","page":"Home","title":"CopositivityDiscriminants.CoposCheckResult","text":"CoposCheckResult\n\nStructured summary of the result returned by check_copositivity.\n\nInstances are constructed via keyword arguments and contain both the numerical estimate of the minimal parameter t and the certificates produced by HomotopyContinuation.\n\nFields\n\ncopositive::MaybeBool   Tri-state outcome of the copositivity check:\ntrue  – the procedure certifies that the input is copositive;\nfalse – the procedure certifies that it is not copositive;\nmissing – the procedure was inconclusive (e.g. certification failed).\nmethod::Symbol   Method used for the check:\n:general      – Computes all solution of the system and minimal t-value among the positive ones.\n:nonseparable – specialised homotopy for nonseparable signed supports.\nt_min::Float64   Midpoint estimate of the minimal parameter t found by the homotopy continuation setup (the “min-t” value referred to in the documentation of check_copositivity).\nsystem::Union{Nothing, HomotopyContinuation.System}   The HomotopyContinuation.System that was solved in the copositivity check, or nothing if it was not stored.\ncert_result::Union{Nothing, HomotopyContinuation.CertificationResult}   Overall certification result returned by HomotopyContinuation, or nothing if certification was not attempted or not kept.\npositive_certs::Vector{HomotopyContinuation.AbstractSolutionCertificate}   Certificates for the positive solutions that were used to decide copositivity.
